# Testing the PATH Fix for Infinite Loop Issue

This document provides instructions for testing the PATH modification fixes that resolve the infinite spinning loop issue in Claudia.

## Background

The infinite loop was caused by PATH modifications that kept adding the same directories repeatedly, especially when Claude binary was in an NVM directory. The fix implements proper PATH deduplication and prevents duplicate entries.

## Automated Tests

### 1. Run Unit Tests

```bash
# From the src-tauri directory
cd src-tauri

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific PATH-related tests
cargo test path_utils
cargo test claude_binary_tests
cargo test path_resolution
```

### 2. Test Coverage

The automated tests cover:
- PATH deduplication logic
- NVM directory detection and handling
- Symlink resolution
- Edge cases (empty PATH, PATH with spaces, etc.)
- Concurrent PATH modifications
- Prevention of infinite loops

## Manual Testing

### 1. Build and Run the Application

```bash
# From the project root
cd /Volumes/vredrick2/Claudia/claudia

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run tauri dev
```

### 2. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Basic Claude Code Session
1. Open Claudia
2. Navigate to CC Projects
3. Select or create a project
4. Start a new Claude Code session
5. Enter a command like "hello" or "what files are in this directory?"
6. **Expected**: The command executes successfully without infinite spinning

#### Scenario B: Multiple Commands
1. In an active session, run multiple commands in succession:
   - First command: "list files"
   - Second command: "show me the package.json"
   - Third command: "what does this project do?"
2. **Expected**: All commands execute without the spinner getting stuck

#### Scenario C: NVM-installed Claude
If you have Claude installed via NVM:
1. Ensure Claude is installed through NVM
2. Start Claudia
3. Create a new session
4. Run commands
5. **Expected**: Commands execute normally, no infinite loop

#### Scenario D: Environment Variable Check
1. Before starting Claudia, check your PATH:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```
2. Start Claudia and run some commands
3. After closing Claudia, check PATH again:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```
4. **Expected**: PATH should not have duplicate entries

### 3. Debug Logging

To see PATH modifications in action:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug bun run tauri dev
```

Look for log messages like:
- "Enhanced PATH for macOS app bundle"
- "Adding NVM bin directory to PATH"
- "Directory already in PATH, skipping"

### 4. Stress Testing

To ensure the fix handles edge cases:

1. **Rapid Command Execution**: Send multiple commands quickly without waiting for responses
2. **Long Running Sessions**: Keep a session open for 10+ minutes with periodic commands
3. **Multiple Sessions**: Open multiple projects/sessions simultaneously

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Unit tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] First command in a session executes successfully
- [ ] Subsequent commands execute without infinite spinning
- [ ] PATH doesn't contain duplicate entries after multiple commands
- [ ] Debug logs show proper PATH deduplication
- [ ] No regression in other features

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Claude Installation**:
   ```bash
   which claude
   claude --version
   ```

2. **Clear Application Data**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.tauri.claudia
   ```

3. **Check for Multiple Claude Installations**:
   ```bash
   # Find all claude binaries
   find / -name claude -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(bin/claude|claude$)"
   ```

4. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=trace bun run tauri dev
   ```

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems:

1. Note the exact steps to reproduce
2. Include the Claude version and installation method
3. Provide relevant log output
4. Share your PATH environment variable (sanitized if needed)

## Performance Testing

The PATH deduplication should have minimal performance impact:

1. Time the application startup
2. Measure command execution time
3. Monitor memory usage during long sessions

Expected performance characteristics:
- Startup time: < 2 seconds
- Command execution: No noticeable delay from PATH processing
- Memory: No memory leaks from PATH string manipulation
